implemented read methods
  readv
  recv
  Win: WSARecv
  Win: read
implemented write methods
  sendfile/mmap
  writev
  send
  Win: WSASend
  Win: write

Does Win iovec supports sockaddr ?

pread => fd
read => fd, conn_sock
readv => fd, conn_sock, iovec
recv => fd, conn_sock
recvfrom => fd, conn_sock, sock
recvmsg => fd, conn_sock, sock, iovec
pwrite => fd
write => fd, conn_sock
writev => fd, conn_sock, iovec
send => fd, conn_sock
sendmsg => fd, conn_sock, sock, iovec
sendto => fd, conn_sock, sock
sendfile => sock

my new evbuffer_read uses FIONREAD, then call cb

to choose a cb implementation
when fd is set, evbuffer flags are added to describe the fd
sendfile is used if the socket is connected and the buffer is EVBUFFER_SENDFILE'd
iovec can always be used (check Win)
then will need to check performance of each method to prioritize them correctly
